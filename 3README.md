In this package, my arrays, StudentData, and EvenorOdd activities reside. This package was a fun one to put together, the even or odd activity was straightforward and one of the first activities we did this semester. The studentData activity was the hardest out of the three, I had a tough time assigning certain things to certain places but in the end prevailed with a working and interactive activity.
