In this package I really enjoyed the outcome of all the activities. The triangles activity was very neat in the regard that it could tell you in the end of the process which form of triangle you inputted. To the outside it may seem like a complex program that is able to differentiate between different forms of triangles, but in the actually meat of the code it is a very simple process with only a few integers that it bases the results off of. Activity 9 was a guessing game that I had a bit of trouble with due to it being an early in the semester activity and one of our first times using arrays and scanners together.
