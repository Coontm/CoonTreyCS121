In my 5th package of my portfolio, I have my palindrome, pokemonSelector, and restaurantSelector as my given activities. I enjoyed this package because of the programming process of having it select an output based on variable given by the user. I found the restaurant selector more challenging because of the incorporation of different attributes within selections, such as vegetarian and etc.
